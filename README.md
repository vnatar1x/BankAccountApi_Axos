# BankAccountApi_Axos
Sample REST API for Axos

During yesterday’s 9/15 interview session, we didn’t have time to go through a coding exercise—I mainly explained my work verbally. To provide more clarity for Sunil, I spent an hour in putting together a sample API project from scratch that reflects the concepts I was describing.

The project includes:

- Aspect Oriented Programming for logging
- Best practices in design and coding
- Dapper as a lightweight ORM
- Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Sample unit tests for providers
- AutoMapper with profiles
- Database scripts

I’d appreciate it if you could kindly share the attached project with Sunil from Axos for his review.
